# ðŸ§® C++ Command-Line Calculator

This is a beginner C++ project scaffold. The goal is to build a CLI-based calculator to practice basic C++ control flow, user input, and functions.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Organizing code into `.h` and `.cpp` files
- Creating reusable functions and class methods
- Handling user input and menu loops
- Writing safe code for edge cases like divide by zero
  
## ðŸ§± Tasks

- [ ] Implement functions for add, subtract, multiply, divide
- [ ] Handle division by zero
- [ ] Add a loop menu to process multiple operations
- [ ] Use header and source file separation

## ðŸ”§ Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./cpp_calculator
